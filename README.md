# Fast Rolimon's profile lookup

# Instruction
No need to make a long instruction, after you opened the program just type in someone's roblox username and press enter (if you typed in someone's old username its also gonna work).
After a few seconds you are gonna get what you wanted.
Before opening the program make sure you downloaded all the requirements from requirements.txt and also make sure you installed python on your computer, otherwise it won't work.
